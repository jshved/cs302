# Project 5 - Letter Dice

**[Project 5 Write Up](https://github.com/logantillman/cs_302/blob/master/project05/project05.pdf)**

## Data Structures / Algorithms Used

* Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
* Breadth First Search Algorithm
* Queue

## Post-Lab Questions 

***What is complexity of your implementation?***

***Explain this by describing which data structures you used and how you used them to implement network flow.***

For our implementation of Edmonds Karps the complexity is O(VE^2), we used a combination of a queue within our BFS and vectors within our nodes to connect edges and find backedges
