# Project5

What is complexity of your implementation?

Explain this by describing which data structures you used and how you used them to implement network flow.

For our implementation of Edmonds Karps the complexity is O(VE^2), we used a combination of a queue within our BFS and vectors within our nodes to connect edges and find backedges

# Individual Contribution

My individual Contribution to this project was setting up the beginning of the file, working with the classes and reading the inputs from the words and dice files. As well as coding and testing the connections of the graph plus helping my teammate with his implementation of BFS and Edmonds Karps in order to fix segmentation faults and other small errors, I also coded the deletion of nodes and resetting of backedges as the words change.
